# GitHub Workflow Activity

## Form teams of 2-3 persons

We suggest you work with someone who is uses the same operating system as you. 
_Teams are assigned in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vBWP3on0b3NWF_Vso_Qk18I8pmlWPhW2rvgHwR1BD04/edit?usp=sharing)._

## Instructions

1. (2 minutes) Ensure that each of your team members ...

    - [ ] Has git installed on their laptop.
    - [ ] Is logged into their GitHub account on their computer.

2. (1 minute) Open [this shared Google Doc to take notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmXnHzB3lVCibH7GBOUqPDiIjG7x67VOqJcoT3seRwQ/edit?usp=sharing).

3. (2 minutes) Assign the role of _maintainer_ to one of your team members. They should use this [GitHub classroom invitation](https://classroom.github.com/g/7DYJfpBe) to create a new team and repository for this activity. The other team members should join.

4. (2 minutes) Take a moment and reflect on your experience in the previous step. Record in your shared editor any insights you have learned or any questions that you still have. __Get confirmation from Prof Davis before continuing.__

5. (10 minutes) Assign the role of _contributor_ to one of your team members and help them [Prepare to contribute to a project](prepare-to-contribute-to-a-project.md). Return here when you are done.

6. (2 minutes) Take a moment and reflect on your experience in the previous step. Record in your shared editor any insights you have learned or any questions that you still have. __Get confirmation from Prof Davis before continuing.__

7. (5 minutes) If you were the _contributor_ in the previous step, help your other team members play the role of _contributor_ and complete the previous step __in parallel__.

8. (15 minutes) Assign the role of _maintainer_ to one of your team members, and the role of _contributor_ to another. Your team's goal is to have the _contributor_ create a new file `favorite-foods.txt` in the root of the project containing a couple of their favorite foods. Follow the __Contribution Workflow__ to accomplish this goal. _Maintainer_, when asked to review the PR, accept and merge the PR.
    * [Contribution Workflow](contribution-workflow.md)

9. (5 minutes) Take a moment and reflect on your experience in the previous step. Record in your shared editor any insights you have learned or any questions that you still have. __Get confirmation from Prof Davis before continuing.__

10. (10 minutes) Reassign the roles of _maintainer_ and _contributor_ to different team members. Your team's goal is to have the _contributor_ add a couple of their favorite foods to `favorite-foods.txt`. Follow the __Contribution Workflow__ to accomplish this goal. ___BUT THIS TIME___, _maintainer_, when asked to review the PR, request an alteration (e.g., "no lettuce please"). Once the change is made, then accept and merge the PR.
    * [Contribution Workflow](contribution-workflow.md)

11. (2 minutes) Take a moment and reflect on your experience in the previous step. Record in your shared editor any insights you have learned or any questions that you still have. __Get confirmation from Prof Davis before continuing.__

12. (10 minutes) This time, everyone is a _contributor_ and a _maintainer_. However, you cannot serve as a _maintainer_ for you own PR. Follow the __Contribution Workflow__ in parallel to accomplish the following:
    * Add `favorite-movies.txt`
    * Add `favorite-books.txt`
    * (if you have three members) Add `favorite-sports.txt`

13. (2 minutes) Take a moment and reflect on your experience in the previous step. Record in your shared editor any insights you have learned or any questions that you still have. __Get confirmation from Prof Davis before continuing.__

14. (20 minutes) Again, everyone plays the roles of a _contributor_ and a _maintainer_, but never serves as a _maintainer_ for their own PR. This time you will try to force a conflict so that you can experience resolving a conflict in the context of the __Contribution Workflow__. Complete the three tasks below in parallel. Note that only the first PR should merge successfully. The others should require resolving conflicts. Tasks:
    * Sort the foods in `favorite-foods.txt` in ascending order.
    * After each food in `favorite-foods.txt` add one or more labels to categorize the food (e.g., `[vegetable]`, `[fruit]`, `[meat]`, etc.)
    * (if you have three members) Reformat the list of foods in `favorite-foods.txt` so that every item has a bullet in front (e.g., `*`). If they already have a bullet, change the bullet to a different style of bullet (e.g., `+` or `-`).

15. (5 minutes) Take a moment and reflect on your experience in the previous step. Record in your shared editor any insights you have learned or any questions that you still have. __Check in with Prof Davis before taking your break.__
